#arduino-projects

Various projects playing with my Arduino Mega 2560.

##seven-segment-integers
Displays positive integers from 0-9999 on a 4-digit 7-segment LED display. LEDs are driven by an 8-bit shift register (74HC595) and the arduino digital pins.

##seven-segment-float
Displays positive floats from 0-9999 on a 4-digit 7-segment LED display. LEDs are driven by an 8-bit shift register (74HC595) and the arduino digital pins.
